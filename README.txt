# Clicker Madness Version 0.8.5 Open Beta! 

## Introduction
>Clicker madness is a simple game of skill and memorization. Different colored circles will flash across the screen, and the player must click on them to score as high a score as possible. There are dangers though! Some circles subtract points, and you can go into the negatives! Other circles can take all your points away. Its important to remember which ones are good, and which ones are bad, as well as have fast and accurate clicking! 



## Circle Types

> Green = 2 Points
> Yellow = 3 Points
> Blue = 5 Points
> Purple = 10 Points
> Indigo = -5 Points
> Lime = Score reset to 0.
> Red = Game Over. 

## Installation

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.
